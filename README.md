### 🍂 Hello 🍂

👩‍💻 I am engaged in [Istanbul Kodluyor](https://istanbulkodluyor.com/istanbul-kodluyor) project at present. 
<br><br/>
I love everything about data and reading! Consequently, writing, critical thinking, academia, coding, and business problem-solving have become natural byproducts.
<br><br/>
Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn 💬
